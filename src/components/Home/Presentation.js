              Athekrist, God of the planet <b className="purple">PPN-54/83 </b> sends to our Earth some Pipouns, these crazy celebrities who are here in test. He wants to know if they are fit to live on <b className="purple">PPN-54/83</b>, and it is YOU, Pipounians, who will vote and choose who will be crazy enough to stay on Earth and who will be too serious, we will send him back to be bored with Athekrist.

Because ATK doesn't know it, but we like the crazy and the laughter.
